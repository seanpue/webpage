I added the Urdu translation of the blog software, and I also translated the
blog commands into Hindi. Should I care to, I can now compose Hindi and Urdu
versions of my posts. The translations of the blog
software are crowdsourced_.

I do not do much computing in Hindi, so I checked some of the phrases against
the Wordpress translations in addition to querying to see how many instances
there of particular words. For example, one phrase I was wavering on was the
word for archive. अभिलेखागार *abhilekhāgār* or “archive” has 217,000 hits (many of
which are Indian government archive websites), whereas अार्काइव *ārkāiv* has
592,000. That‘s what the Urdu translation went with as آرکائیو. So I went with
अार्काइव. On the other hand, The Hindi word for “categories,” श्रेणियाँ *shreṇiyāñ*,
had 814,000 pages, whereas कैटेगरी *kaiṭegarī* had 129,000 and the plural form
कैटेगरियां only 49,100. 

I am trying to figure out now what the best current CSS_ styling is for displaying Hindi and Urdu text on the Internet. Most browsers on recent computers can handle displaying the text correctly. Urdu in its preferred script, *nastaʿlīq*, is rather difficult to render, so I would be curious to hear suggestions. There are ways of embedding fonts in webpages that might be a possibility. I have not been following those technologies very closely, and so it will be interesting to find out how standardized the techniques are at this point.
