I have not updated my blog in such a long time! I hope to fix that, starting now. So watch out for a slew of new posts, until I run out of steam.

I should note, since I mentioned it in an earlier post, that I did get promoted with tenure. So I am now an associate professor. It's an interesting feeling. I want to write more about that in the near future and also think more about the whole university tenure process. All in good time, I suppose.
