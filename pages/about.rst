I intend this website to serve as a place to write about my current research and
personal interests. Some of my posts may seem excessively technical, gnomic, or
not yet fit for public consumption, but I am very interested in receiving
feedback from specialists and enthusiasts in regards to these ramblings, which
likely involve my current work product.  Please feel free to comment.

More details on my research, teaching, service, background, and personal
interests are below. My CV_ is available online with a list of my publications_.

Research
========

      :title: I Too Have Some Dreams
      :class: link-figure
      :image_url: /galleries/i2havesomedreams/i2havesomedreams-small.jpg

My main research area is **South Asian literature**–especially in Urdu, Hindi,
and Persian (Farsi)–but my new research involves other languages, including
Punjabi, Bengali (Bangla), and Braj Bhasha. My book `I Too Have Some Dreams: N.
M. Rashed and Modernism in Urdu Poetry
<http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520283107>`_, was published by
University of California Press in August 2014. I have made a resource page for
the book `here <http://seanpue.com/itoohavesomedreams>`_.

I am also completing a separate volume of translations of N. M. Rashed's poems
that are organized thematically. This volume supplements the translations
included in *I Too Have Some Dreams*, which are limited to those related to its
argument. This book makes additional dimensions of Rashed's poetry accessible to
English speakers and includes notes on themes and individual poems.

Cutting across this research agenda is my exploration of methods and issues
associated with digital humanities. I have been involved in computational
humanities research related to South Asian literature and language for over a
decade. I use computational methodologies to supplement my research in literary
history, working with texts on both macro and micro levels.

I have started work on a second book project titled “Publics of Sound: The
Politics of Literary Innovation in Modern South Asia.” Through chapters focused
on individual writers and movements, the book maps out the politics of sound and
musicality in the discourse and practice of poetic modernism in Urdu and Hindi.
That book will combine literary historical methodologies with what I call
“data-rich analysis” of text and performance. I use digital tools to seek and
identify patterns in a multilingual modernist corpus from roughly 1900 to the
1980s, drawing on a richly annotated collection of texts and performances. “Publics of Sound”
focuses on Hindi and Urdu but also involves other languages and poetic
traditions, as well.

While the literary historical aspects of this project grew
out of research for my first book, the computational techniques grew out of a
very productive `collaboration with computational biologists
<http://www.cal.msu.edu/biologistshumanities>`_  in using bioinformatic
algorithms to detect the meter of Urdu poetry. I have extended our initial work
to include free verse in Hindi and Urdu. I have expanded my toolkit to include
methods from computational linguistics and natural language processing, as well
as computer and data science, adapting techniques developed in those disciplines
to my literary research. I was fortunate to receive an `Andrew W. Mellon New
Directions Fellowship
<https://mellon.org/programs/higher-education-and-scholarship-humanities/fellowships/new-directions-fellowships/>`_
which allowed me to take advanced courses in data and computer science as well
as linguistics at Michigan State University and at the Linguistics Institute
over twelve months. In addition to my literary historical writing, I have
forthcoming software and technical papers exploring the intersection of natural
language processing and digital humanities and on methods for developing and
producing annotated digital texts and performances.

Through my work in digital humanities, I have developed a research interest in
digital culture, especially in relation to South Asian poetry, and I hope to
soon be publishing in that domain, too.

I have completed a few projects on
**second-language acquisition** involving digital technologies. I have taught Hindi
and Urdu language, and I am excited about the possibilities of language learning
and teaching online. I have received minimal training in SLA, all of it
postdoctoral, but I do consider it a tertiary field of my research, as well as a
component of my teaching and service.


Teaching
========

I am currently on sabbatical and so will not be teaching until Fall 2018.

At MSU, I am the faculty director for a new minor program in `Indian and South
Asian Languages and Cultures`_. That involves language learning or competence
in any of the numerous languages of South Asia as well as additional elective
courses. I recently taught a class on **Language, Literature, and Belonging in
South Asia**, and will be reteaching it in Fall 2018 as well as developing
a lower-level undergraduate **Introduction to South Asian Cultures** class for
Spring 2019. I have also taught a course on **“Gandhi's
India in History, Literature, and Film”** as part of MSU's integrative studies
program.

I also coordinate MSU's **Hindi/Urdu** language program, working with our new
assistant professor who is a specialist in second language acquisition.

I have a joint appointment in MSU's undergraduate and graduate program in
`Global Studies in Arts and Humanities`_ for which I have developed three classes
and am currently developing a fourth. My first lower-level
course, **“Encountering Difference: East-West, North-South,”** focuses on the
historical development of ideas of civilization over the longue durée, through
readings of Hafiz, Goethe, Iqbal, Conrad, Tyeb Salih, and Shahid Ali.  I
encourage students to look at ideas of civilization in contemporary discourse
and cultural production.  I developed a second lower-level course on **“Global
Espionage: Identity, Intelligence, Power”** that highlights key concepts in
global studies and theory through readings of spy fiction and film that reflect
the geopolitics of the era of high colonialism, the Cold War, and the
contemporary post-9/11 world. Much of that class focused on the area of the
“Great Game,” including India, but with excursions into the war in Vietnam and
Cyberspace. More recently I taught an upper-level undergraduate course on
migration entitled **“Partition, Displacement, and Cultural Memory.”** It
addresses the displacements caused by the partition of states through the
twentieth century, focusing particularly on Ireland/Northern Ireland,
India/Pakistan, and Israel/Palestine. In Fall 2018 I will teach a new course on
**Global Digital Cultures**.

I am also part of the faculty for MSU’s certificate program in `Digital Humanities`_,
for which I developed the **“Digital Humanities Seminar.”** That course focused on the question of
how to deal with the big data of the digital age, and how we can use digital
tools and technologies to empower our analysis, criticism, and creativity.
A hands-on class that mixes theory and practice, the course culminated  in a final
project for the students and involved various faculty members from units throughout
MSU.  I am developing a new course for
Spring 2019 tentatively titled **Introduction to Digital Cultures**.

Service
=======

My service at MSU has primarily been oriented towards my college, `Arts and
Letters`_, mostly in regards to the programs mentioned above, as well to my
department—`Linguistics and Germanic, Slavic, Asian, and African Languages`_,
which will soon be part of the School
of Language Science and Literary and Cultural Studies. I
also work extensively with the `Asian Studies Center`_ and the `Muslim Studies
Program`_, both part of International Studies and Programs at MSU.

From 2014-5, I served as the Director of the Digital Humanities program, and I stepped
down from that position to take the Mellon fellowship. During my tenure, I worked to
solidify and plan for the future of the Digital Humanities program, which was still
fairly new. At that time, we identified three areas of strength: global engagement,
cultural preservation and access, and computation.
My colleague Kristen Mapes and I, together with an expanded steering committee,
organized a `Global Digital Humanities Symposium`_, that is now scheduled
to run for its third year. It was supported by nineteen units (programs, departments,
and centers) of the university.

In 2009, I brought MSU into the `American Institute of Pakistan Studies`_ and
have since served as MSU's representative on its Board of Trustees. I also
served on its Executive Committee for three years. I am very happy to
be assisting with the workings of the Institute, which primarily involve
supporting scholarly research and teaching about Pakistan as well as
facilitating scholarly exchanges between Pakistani and U.S. academic
institutions.

I currently serve on the editorial board of two journals, the Urdu/English
journal `Bunyaad`_, published by the Gurmani Centre of the Lahore University of
Management Science (LUMS), and `Sagar: A South Asia Research Journal`_, published by
the South Asia Institute at the University of Texas at Austin.

Background
==========

I am currently on sabbatical until Fall 2018 and affiliated with the
South Asia Institute at the University of **Heidelberg**. I am very impressed by
my new German colleagues and by Germany in general.

In summer 2014, I was awarded tenure and promoted to associate professor at
Michigan State University. I moved to **East Lansing** and started working at
MSU in 2008.

Immediately before that, I was a research associate for two years based at the
University of Chicago at the (now unfortunately defunct) South Asian Language
Resource Center, where I coordinated South Asian language materials development
and teacher training on a national level. At the U of C., I also had an
opportunity to teach advanced literature classes in Urdu and Hindi. I love
**Chicago** and have very happy memories from that stage of my life, most
especially the birth of my daughter.

Before Chicago, I had the wonderful opportunity to attend graduate school at
Columbia University in the city of **New York**.  I began in the M.A./Ph.D.
program in what was then called Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures,
and is now the `Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian,
and African Studies`_ (MESAAS). I then entered the `Comparative Literature and
Society`_ program, eventually earning a Ph.D. in Middle East and Asian Languages
and Culture and Comparative Literature and Society, which is quite a mouthful
indeed.  `Frances Pritchett`_ was my Ph.D. supervisor.  In the course of my
Ph.D. research, I lived in India, mostly in **Delhi**, for one year on a
Fulbright fellowship. I also spent most of a summer in **Chandigarh** studying
Punjabi.

The year before starting graduate school, I lived in **Lahore**, as a student of
the Berkeley Urdu Language Program in Pakistan (BULPIP), which was great. I also
had an opportunity then to do a little traveling in northern Pakistan, which was
amazing.

Before that, I was an undergraduate in the city of **Berkeley** at the
University of California, where I majored in South and Southeast Asian Studies
and in Religious Studies. I blame the late Aditya Behl, my undergraduate
advisor and later also a member of my Ph.D. committee, for luring me to South Asian
literature and to academia.

I was born and raised in the city of **San Diego**, California.

Personal Interests
==================

I enjoy computer programming, and I am
currently excited about the Python language, which I find very readable, quick,
and easy to use. I used to program more in Perl and before that in Java. For
web-based work, I have also used PHP and Javascript, as well as XSLT. I like the
content management system Drupal quite a bit, but I wish it was written in
Python, and I generally prefer static pages these days. I also use C/C++, R, and
Matlab/Octave. Back in the day, I worked in Pascal, Basic, and Assembly,
and I have very hazy memories of Logo.

My other mostly indoor hobbies include reading, music, and cooking.

Outside, I enjoy traveling, hiking, biking, bird watching, skiing, being by or in water
(both fresh and salt), and scuba diving.
