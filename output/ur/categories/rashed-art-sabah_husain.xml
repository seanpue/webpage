M. Rashed in the Art Gallery</title><link>http://seanpue.com/ur/posts/n-m-rashed-in-the-art-gallery/</link><dc:creator>A. Sean Pue</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few people contacted me recently to tell me about a gallery show of
&lt;a href="http://www.sabahhusain.com/"&gt;Sabah Husain&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.koel.com.pk/"&gt;Koel
Gallery&lt;/a&gt; in Karachi. The show was titled
&lt;a href="http://www.koelgallery.com/xhtml/exhibition/27_poetics_of_memory_by_sabah_husain/index.html"&gt;ʿPoetics of
Memoryʾ&lt;/a&gt;,
and engaged with the poetry of N. M. Rashed, particularly the long
four-part poem &lt;a href="http://seanpue.com/itoohavesomedreams/poem_26/"&gt;Hasan Kuzahgar&lt;/a&gt;
(Hasan the Potter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poem is central to Rashed's oeuvre and legacy. I have discussed it
in extensively in the conclusion of my book, &lt;a href="http://seanpue.com/itoohavesomedreams/"&gt;I Too Have Some
Dreams&lt;/a&gt;, in relation to four major
themes—embodiment, position without identity, allegory and collectivity,
and temporality. There I describe it is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many critics consider it to be one the greatest statements about love
and creativity in Urdu poetry, the masterpiece of Rashed’s late
period, and among the finest free-verse poems in the language. The
poem is a monologue in which the potter Ḥasan addresses the
mesmerizing Jahāñzād (literally “daughter of the world”). Each section
is set in a different time and place, and each is a variation on a
single theme. As such, it resembles a pot, being made and remade.
Altogether, the poem narrates Hasan’s transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Sabah Husain‘s show attests, that poem remains a favorite of
Urdu-speaking artists, potters and printmakers alike. Her work engages
with selections of the poems text, as well its imagery. For &lt;a href="http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/the-poetics-of-memory/"&gt;The Friday
Times&lt;/a&gt; the
artist explained,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rashid talks about Hassan’s inspiration from the rainbow and its seven
colours, butterflies and his lover’s face. So I have these as almost
pictographs. I want the text, the pictograph and the paper made from
the plant fibre, warm and sensuous, to work in unison in these series
[…] And I have taken the liberty of using lines from all his four
poems on Hassan Koozagar and combining them randomly, emphasising
certain strains in the poem […] sometimes repeating a word to show its
many literary and visual dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show consisted of a paper collages called the “Baghdad
Manuscripts”—Hasan Kuzahgar takes place in Baghdad and Aleppo—as well as
a series of paper boats evocative of both Lahore's Ravi River and the
Tigris of Baghdad, another important site for Hasan's story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabah Husain picks up on some Rashed’s most memorable phrases in her
artwork, such as my favorite, the &lt;em&gt;shahr-e madfūn&lt;/em&gt;, or buried city, which
occurs a few times within his poetry towards different ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is exciting to see, once again, the interpenetration of literary and
artistic worlds in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent reviews of the show are by &lt;a href="http://epaper.dawn.com/DetailNews.php?StoryText=30_08_2015_430_004"&gt;Amra Ali
(Dawn)&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/journey-to-change/"&gt;Raza Rumi (The Friday
Times)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
