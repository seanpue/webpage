&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would not be upset if readers judged my book’s insides by its gorgeous cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The painting is by Zahoor-ul-Akhlaq (1941–99), a prominent South Asian artist who spent most of his life in the city of Lahore. There are to my mind significant parallels between Zahoor’s painting and N. M. Rashed’s poetry, particularly in their relation to tradition. This painting is untitled but usually referred to as “Falling Bird.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those readers who know Urdu, the cover reminds me of a poem of Rashed’s that begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ہمیں یاد ہے وہ درخت جس سے چلے ہیں ہم&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;hameñ yād hai vuh daraḳht jis se chale haiñ ham&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We remember that tree from which we departed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book will be out in August with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520283107"&gt;University of California Press&lt;/a&gt;. That's the press of my undergraduate alma mater, so I am thrilled to be publishing with them, and they have been great to work with. The book is in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.saacrossdisciplines.org/%E2%80%8E"&gt;South Asia Across the Disciplines&lt;/a&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am traveling to the Association for Asian Studies conference this week in Philadelphia. I have heard from friends that traveling is a great time to write blog posts, so I hope to post more soon!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://seanpue.com/ur/posts/book-cover/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 20:31:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Miraji’s Favorite Words</title><link>http://seanpue.com/ur/posts/mirajis-favorite-words/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am working on a paper on the first volumes of free verse, or &lt;em&gt;āzad naz̤m&lt;/em&gt;, in Urdu to be submitted to a festschrift for Shamsur Rahman Faruqi, the famous Urdu critic and writer who has been my own advisor Frances Pritchett's teacher and collaborator. As part of that work, I have had the Urdu poet Mīrājī’s volume &lt;em&gt;Mīrājī kī naz̤meñ&lt;/em&gt; transcribed, and I am working on a computational analysis of his use of meter as well as sound. I will be comparing Mīrājī’s volume to N. M. Rāshid’s &lt;em&gt;Māvarā&lt;/em&gt; and to Taṣadduq Ḥusain Ḳhālid’s first volume. It’s a very preliminary study, but I am very happy to be spending time with Mīrājī’s poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my mind, a lovely product of that work is a list of Mīrājī’s most common words. For those readers familiar with his oeuvre, these will come as no surprise. Removing the "stop words," or common words that do not reveal much on their own, Mīrājī’s ten most frequent words in that volume are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;dil&lt;/em&gt; (heart)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;rāt&lt;/em&gt; (night)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;bāt&lt;/em&gt; (words, matter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;naz̤ar&lt;/em&gt; (look, glance, sight)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;āñkh&lt;/em&gt; (eye)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;sāyah&lt;/em&gt; (shadow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;rañg&lt;/em&gt; (color)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;pal&lt;/em&gt; (moment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; (mind)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;chāñd&lt;/em&gt; (moon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will do the same for Rāshid and Ḳhālid later, but this list is just too delightful not to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://seanpue.com/ur/posts/mirajis-favorite-words/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2014 10:53:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Added Hindi and Urdu</title><link>http://seanpue.com/ur/posts/added-hindi-and-urdu/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I added the Urdu translation of the blog software, and I also translated the
blog commands into Hindi. Should I care to, I can now compose Hindi and Urdu
versions of my posts. The translations of the blog
software are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/nikola/"&gt;crowdsourced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not do much computing in Hindi, so I checked some of the phrases against
the Wordpress translations in addition to querying to see how many instances
there are of particular words on the Internet. For example, one phrase I was
wavering on was the word for archive. अभिलेखागार &lt;em&gt;abhilekhāgār&lt;/em&gt; or “archive” has
217,000 hits (many of which are Indian government archive websites), whereas
अार्काइव &lt;em&gt;ārkāiv&lt;/em&gt; has 592,000. That‘s what the Urdu translation went with as
آرکائیو. So I went with अार्काइव. On the other hand, The Hindi word for
“categories,” श्रेणियाँ &lt;em&gt;shreṇiyāñ&lt;/em&gt;, had 814,000 pages, whereas कैटेगरी &lt;em&gt;kaiṭegarī&lt;/em&gt; had
129,000 and the plural form कैटेगरियां only 49,100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to figure out now what the best current &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://seanpue.com/ur/posts/added-hindi-and-urdu/_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt; styling is for
displaying Hindi and Urdu text on the Internet. Most browsers on recent
computers can handle displaying the text to the extent that it is at least
readable. Urdu in its preferred script, &lt;em&gt;nastaʿlīq&lt;/em&gt;, is rather difficult to
render, so I would be curious to hear suggestions. There are ways of embedding
fonts in webpages that might be a possibility. I have not been following those
technologies very closely, and so it will be interesting to find out how
standardized the techniques are at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://seanpue.com/ur/posts/added-hindi-and-urdu/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2014 20:30:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Welcome to My Blog</title><link>http://seanpue.com/ur/posts/welcome-to-my-blog/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have decided to start a blog.” The thought had, of course, crossed my mind
many times before. But I always decided to wait until I was a little further
along—with my job search, with my book project, with my tenure application.
When I was working at the University of Chicago, a well-known blogger-academic
warned about a negative correlation between blogging and tenure. That stuck in
my mind. Are things different now for people like me than they were six years
ago? Yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main motivation for starting this website is to have a venue to write
publically about aspects of my research that are not necessarily publishable in
other venues. They may be of interest to some people who could potentially
offer feedback. They may be early drafts. They may be rants. Let us see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written a little about myself and my research on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://seanpue.com/about"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create this website I am using a program called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;. It took me
a little while to get comfortable with it, but it seems quite nice so far.  It
creates static webpages, so there is no code running this website. I really
didn’t want to have to deal with updating software versions, security issues,
and so on.  There is also an Urdu translation that I will try and implement in
the near future. The software is open source and a bit techy, so there are lots
of options. It‘s easily extendable, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am entering the pages in a format called ReStructuredText (RST), so they are
quite clean. You can view the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://seanpue.com/posts/welcome-to-my-blog/index.rst"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to extend the
format. Since much of my work involves Hindi and Urdu, I am particularly
interested in seeing if I can adapt it for other needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also moved my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://seanpue.com/cv"&gt;C.V.&lt;/a&gt; into the RST format. Using the program rst2latex, I
have created a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://seanpue.com/ur/posts/welcome-to-my-blog/_/cv.pdf"&gt;PDF version&lt;/a&gt;. I do not normally use LaTeX, so it was a
bit of challenge formatting the PDF. There is an rst2pdf program, but the
results look more like a webpage.  Now I have no excuse not to keep
my C.V. up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to follow best collaborative computing practices on
this blog and webpage. So the entire blog is available as a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/seanpue/webpage"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; on Github,
and my C.V. is a separate project treated as a submodule. If I come up with any
interesting software solutions on this blog then they should be easily
available to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all for now. I have to figure out how to deploy the site to my server.
If you are reading this, it must have worked!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://seanpue.com/ur/posts/welcome-to-my-blog/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2014 07:06:17 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
