blog commands into Hindi. Should I care to, I can now compose Hindi and Urdu
versions of my posts. The translations of the blog
software are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/nikola/"&gt;crowdsourced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not do much computing in Hindi, so I checked some of the phrases against
the Wordpress translations in addition to querying to see how many instances
there of particular words. For example, one phrase I was wavering on was the
word for archive. अभिलेखागार &lt;em&gt;abhilekhāgār&lt;/em&gt; or “archive” has 217,000 hits (many of
which are Indian government archive websites), whereas अार्काइव &lt;em&gt;ārkāiv&lt;/em&gt; has
592,000. That‘s what the Urdu translation went with as آرکائیو. So I went with
अार्काइव. On the other hand, The Hindi word for “categories,” श्रेणियाँ &lt;em&gt;shreṇiyāñ&lt;/em&gt;,
had 814,000 pages, whereas कैटेगरी &lt;em&gt;kaiṭegarī&lt;/em&gt; had 129,000 and the plural form
कैटेगरियां only 49,100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to figure out now what the best current &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://seanpue.com/posts/added-hindi-and-urdu/_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt; styling is for displaying Hindi and Urdu text on the Internet. Most browsers on recent computers can handle displaying the text correctly. Urdu in its preferred script, &lt;em&gt;nastaʿlīq&lt;/em&gt;, is rather difficult to render, so I would be curious to hear suggestions. There are ways of embedding fonts in webpages that might be a possibility. I have not been following those technologies very closely, and so it will be interesting to find out how standardized the techniques are at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>hindi urdu translation css</category><guid>http://seanpue.com/posts/added-hindi-and-urdu/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2014 20:30:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Welcome to My Blog</title><link>http://seanpue.com/posts/welcome-to-my-blog/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have decided to start a blog.” The thought had, of course, crossed my mind
many times before. But I always decided to wait until I was a little further
along—with my job search, with my book project, with my tenure application.
When I was working at the University of Chicago, a well-known blogger-academic
warned about a negative correlation between blogging and tenure. That stuck in
my mind. Are things different now for people like me than they were six years
ago? Yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main motivation for starting this website is to have a venue to write
publically about aspects of my research that are not necessarily publishable in
other venues. They may be of interest to some people who could potentially
offer feedback. They may be early drafts. They may be rants. Let us see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written a little about myself and my research on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://seanpue.com/about"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create this website I am using a program called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;. It took me
a little while to get comfortable with it, but it seems quite nice so far.  It
creates static webpages, so there is no code running this website. I really
didn’t want to have to deal with updating software versions, security issues,
and so on.  There is also an Urdu translation that I will try and implement in
the near future. The software is open source and a bit techy, so there are lots
of options. It‘s easily extendable, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am entering the pages in a format called ReStructuredText (RST), so they are
quite clean. You can view the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://seanpue.com/posts/welcome-to-my-blog/index.rst"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to extend the
format. Since much of my work involves Hindi and Urdu, I am particularly
interested in seeing if I can adapt it for other needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also moved my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://seanpue.com/cv"&gt;C.V.&lt;/a&gt; into the RST format. Using the program rst2latex, I
have created a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://seanpue.com/posts/welcome-to-my-blog/_/cv.pdf"&gt;PDF version&lt;/a&gt;. I do not normally use LaTeX, so it was a
bit of challenge formatting the PDF. There is an rst2pdf program, but the
results look more like a webpage.  Now I have no excuse not to keep
my C.V. up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to follow best collaborative computing practices on
this blog and webpage. So the entire blog is available as a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/seanpue/webpage"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; on Github,
and my C.V. is a separate project treated as a submodule. If I come up with any
interesting software solutions on this blog then they should be easily
available to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all for now. I have to figure out how to deploy the site to my server.
If you are reading this, it must have worked!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>blogging</category><category>academic</category><guid>http://seanpue.com/posts/welcome-to-my-blog/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2014 07:06:17 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
