    <div>
<p>Today is the first day of Spring Break, and so I am enjoying some nice weather and not teaching.</p>
<p>I am working on a panel abstract about the poet Majeed Amjad for the <a href="http://southasiaconference.wisc.edu/">Annual Conference on South Asia</a> held in beautiful Madison, Wisconsin.
I have applied to bring a certain professor from Pakistan to the event, and two amazing Urdu professors
from University of Virginia have also signed on to the panel. I do hope it goes forward.</p>
<p>I found an interesting  <a href="http://catalog.crl.edu/record=b2874293~S1">book</a> on Majeed Amjad through my library. It is actually available as PDF through the
<a href="http://www.crl.edu/">Center for Research Libraries</a> (CRL), of which <a href="http://lib.msu.edu">my university library</a> is a member.</p>
<p>It's wonderful to be able to download a PDF of the book. However, I love writing on books.
Actually, I don't like writing on my own books but rather on photocopies of them, especially when doing research. I like to print pages double-sided and then keep the pages in a recycled report cover that I can put it in my file cabinet when I am done. That doesn't take much space, and I can see four pages at a time when reading/skimming.</p>
<p>When printing a PDF, you can print two pages a sheet. For left-to-right documents, that is not a problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recto_and_verso"><img alt="Recto and verso.svg" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Recto_and_verso.svg" height="145" width="218"></a></p>
<p>However, for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left">right-to-left</a> books there is a problem as the verso and recto are reversed, meaning one reads the right page then the left page. It's rather disorienting to read them if they are not printed correctly. So I went about looking for a good solution.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recto_and_verso"><img alt="Recto and verso RTL.svg" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Recto_and_verso_RTL.svg" height="145" width="218"></a></p>
<p>First, I explored a PDF-manipulation library for the Python language called <a href="https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2">PyPDF2</a>. It is quite neat, but I had some
trouble accomplishing the task of merging the pages.</p>
<p>I then stumbled upon a set of PDF shell scripts called <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/firth/software/pdfjam/">PDFjam</a>. I already had them installed on my computer,
perhaps as part of the document preparation system <a href="posts/printing-right-to-left-pdf-books/www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. (I use <a href="https://tug.org/mactex/">MacTex</a> which is a distribution of <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">Tex Live</a> for OS X.)</p>
<p>There is a program in PDFjam called <code>pdfnup</code> which allows to "n-up the pages of pdf files."
To <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-up">n-up</a> apparently means to combine multiple pages into one, so it was very close to what I was looking for. I was delighted to see the package also includes a program called <code>pdfpun</code>—a right-to-left version and exactly what I needed!</p>
<p>For all the other RTL PDF book printers out there, here is the command I used on the original file <code>dds-85303.pdf</code> to save it as <code>gulaab_ke_phuul.pdf</code>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">pdfpun dds-85303.pdf --outfile gulaab_ke_phuul.pdf
</pre>


<p>That was close. However, there was a problem in that the pages were two small. I tried messing around with the
parameters. The CRL puts a cover page on its documents that is a different size then the rest of the pages. So I tried removing that by instead printing the book's cover page twice.  <code>pdfpun</code> allows an optional page-range parameter. I opened up the original PDF and saw that it was 257 pages, so just plugged in the following to print the first page twice and then the rest of the pages:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">pdfpun dds-85303.pdf 2,2,3-257 --outfile gulaab_ke_phuul.pdf
</pre>


<p>The pattern is here:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">pdfpun ORIGFILE PAGERANGE --outfile OUTPUTFILE
</pre>


<p>It worked perfectly. Now I'm off to read the book!</p>

<p>I received a travel grant from the <a href="http://www.pakistanstudies-aips.org">American Institute of Pakistan Studies</a> that
brought me to Karachi and Lahore to give talks in February. This is a (late!) blog post about my rejuvenating visit.</p>
<p>On February 8–10, I attended the amazing <a href="http://www.karachiliteraturefestival.org/">Karachi Literature Festival</a> (KLF) and
participated in a panel launching my new book, <a href="itoohavesomedreams/">I Too Have Some Dreams: N. M.
Rashed and Modernism in Urdu Poetry</a>. The panel was well attended, and the
moderators, <a href="http://habib.edu.pk/AHSS/dr-asif-farrukhi/">Asif Farrukhi</a> and <a href="posts/good-times-in-pakistan/habib.edu.pk/AHSS/sarah-humayun/">Sarah Humayun</a>, both from <a href="http://habib.edu.pk/">Habib University</a>, asked
excellent questions, as did the audience.</p>
<p>In the photo below, I am with friends <a href="http://naizakhan.com/">Naiza Khan</a>, <a href="http://habib.edu.pk/AHSS/dr-asif-farrukhi/">Asif Farrukhi</a>, and <a href="http://habib.edu.pk/AHSS/fahd-ali/">Fahd Ali</a>, and in the second with <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/anthropology/faculty/alik1">Kamran Asdar Ali</a>.</p>

<p>I did not know before arriving that there was an  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/397538987071420/">Art Section</a> to the KLF!  I was very happy to meet a number of artists, most for the first time.  My book has a beautiful work by Zahoor ul Akhlaq
on the cover, as does the new book by art historian Simone Wille, <a href="http://www.tandf.net/books/details/9781138821095/">Modern Art in Pakistan</a>.  In part because of our mutual love of Zahoor's work, I was invited to the session launching her book, sponsored by <a href="http://www.artnowpakistan.com/">Art Now</a>,  to discuss modernism in
literature and art.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129471681@N03/16558844089" title="Zahoor Book Launches @ KLF! by Sean Pue, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8670/16558844089_c732895ca4_n.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="Zahoor Book Launches @ KLF!"></a><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129471681@N03/16139607013" title="With Simone Wille by Sean Pue, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8650/16139607013_cf0da87e93_n.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="With Simone Wille"></a></p>
<p>I was also invited to give a talk at the <a href="posts/good-times-in-pakistan/www.indusvalley.edu.pk/">Indus Valley School of Art and Design (IVS)</a> on
Digital Humanities, and I enjoyed that very much. I am very interested in the design aspects of DH, and
so it is wonderful for me to address some comments about DH to the IVS audience. I also enjoyed meeting members of the <a href="http://www.vaslart.org/">Vasl Artists’ Collective</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129471681@N03/16571923598" title="image001 by Sean Pue, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7611/16571923598_66bab9305e_n.jpg" width="247" height="320" alt="image001"></a><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129471681@N03/16573649879" title="Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture (IVS) by Sean Pue, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7619/16573649879_7ac22680d9_n.jpg" width="240" height="320" alt="Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture (IVS)"></a></p>
<p>I also had a chance to attend an art event organized by the <a href="http://tentativecollective.com/">Tentative Collective</a>
that involved a video projection by <a href="http://naizakhan.com/">Naiza Khan</a> of images of Manora on the side of building
in Golimar, in an alley near the brass artisans that the artist worked with. My partner <a href="http://karinzitzewitz.com">Karin Zitzewitz</a> had curated Naiza Khan’s exhibit <a href="http://broadmuseum.msu.edu/exhibitions/karachi-elegies">Karachi Elegies</a> at the <a href="http://broadmuseum.msu.edu">Eli and Edith Broad Museum</a> at <a href="http://msu.edu">my university</a>, so I had met her before, both in East Lansing
and Karachi. Here are some pictures of that and an audio recording as well:</p>

<p>I also gave a well attended lecture entitled “A ‘Punjabi’ Critique of Sufi
Idiom: N. M. Rashed and Urdu Literary Tradition” for the <a href="http://iba.edu.pk/iba_department_of_social_sciences_and_liberal_arts.php">Department of Social Sciences &amp; Liberal Arts</a> at the <a href="http://iba.edu.pk/">Institute of Business Administration</a> in Karachi. The poster for that talk was quite beautiful, and I am including
it below. My (too) complicated talk was covered in the an <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1162564">article in Dawn</a>. The article is good but misrepresents my characterization of the poets Faiz
and Rashed, which I have discussed in this <a href="http://pakistaniaat.org/index.php/pak/article/view/184">article</a>. My talk was followed by recitations (lovely, of course) by Dr.
<a href="http://research.iba.edu.pk/research_details.php?id=shaq">Nomanul Haq</a>, who has been a friend and colleague of mine for 10(!)+ years. His recitations start at ~52:00 in the audio recording below.</p>

<p>I also gave a talk at <a href="http://habib.edu.pk/">Habib University</a>. That is an entirely new and lively
university with an innovative curriculum. There I gave a talk entitled ‘The
Digital Divan: Computation Approaches to Urdu Poetry.’ There was a beautiful
poster for that as well, and another nice <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/837419/the-digital-divan-dr-sean-pue-explores-ways-to-preserve-urdu-poetry/">article in The Express Tribune</a>.</p>

<p>I later traveled to Lahore where I met with a number of people, including some
literary critics and poets who had helped me with my book research. My friend
the poet Ahmad Attarecited some of his poetry for me and also all four parts of N. M. Rashed’s Hasan Kuzagar. I
hope to post those soon. Ahmad is on the left in the photo below next to M. Salimur Rahman, and with Abbas Tabish and myself in the next. I also made some new friends in Karachi and Lahore
and had a very memorable time. I look forward to returning soon.</p>

<p>M. Salimur Rahman just wrote the first printed Urdu-language review of my book, <a class="reference external" href="posts/itoohavesomedreams">I Too Have Some Dreams</a>. His article is entitled <a class="reference external" href="http://humshehrionline.com/?p=9183">امریکہ میں ن م راشد کے خوابوں کی بازگش</a> (The Return of N M Rashed's Dreams in America) and appeared in the Lahore-based weeky Hum Shehri. Salim Sahab is a respected poet, critic, and translator. His review, on the whole,
was generous and, for the most part, positive. He calls attention to both the form of the book as well as aspects of the argument.</p>
<p>Salim Sahab also states quite correctly that I do not address all of Rashed's poetry but rather focus on thirty poems. Rashed's poetry is quite rich, and there is a lot more to be said about it by others. There are a few aspects of Rashed's poetry I may still want to write about in the future. I am especially interested in his experience and descriptions of New York in the 1950s, for example. I also hope to write or show more about Rashed's uses of sound in comparison to other modern and classical poets. In the process of writing the book I also cut out quite a lot. I may post some of those excerpts here in my blog.</p>
<p>Salim Sahab noted that I mistransliterated the name of Mughni Tabbasum as Mughanni Tabbasum in my book. I say Mughni when I speak, so I am not sure what happened there. I have created a <a class="reference external" href="posts/itoohavesomedreams/errata">list of errata</a> and added those instances to it—all eighteen of them!  There are some other minor (so far!) errors in the book that I have noted, and I am sure there will be more. There may be a revised edition in the future, so I hope readers will let me know if they see anything else.</p>
<p>I do hope my book can be released in India and Pakistan in a revised (and less expensive!) form. I would also be happy if it were one day translated into Urdu and Hindi as well.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, just before the start of the Spring semester here, I attended a "train the trainers" session of
<a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> held on the beautiful campus of the  University of California, Davis (#t3davis). The training session was led by Greg Wilson, the head of Software Carpentry, which advocates for proper computational techniques and using educational psychology to teach them. The trainers are all volunteers, and there was a nice group there. Software Carpentry focuses primarily on teaching good computational skills to scientists. It was a great experience, and I learned quite a lot about pedagogy that is applicable to many different domains. There was a lot of videotaping of teaching and some great discussions about lesson design. I haven't done much work on pedagogy outside of language teaching so it was quite useful for me. I am teaching a <a href="http://seanpue.githubi.io/al340">Digital Humanities Seminar</a> (the topic of my next blog post?) so it is quite relevant to what I am doing right now.</p>
<p>I attended a session of Software Carpentry at Michigan State University a few years ago and found it quite useful. The greatest thing I learned, from my friend Tracy K. Teal, a microbial biologist and current director of <a href="http://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a>, is what is called tab completion—a way to complete a command on the command line by hitting the tab key. I wish I had known that years before.</p>
<p>From my perspective, there is a huge amount overlap in what scientists and humanists like myself need in terms of computational training, and Software Carpentry and the new Data Carpentry workshops are a great way to teach a lot very quickly.</p>
<p>We are going to be hosting a simultaneous Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry session at/after the <a href="http://hastac2015.org">HASTAC 2015</a> conference held at my university, <a href="http://msu.edu">Michigan State</a>. (It's apparently pronounced 'hay stack' and stands for <a href="http://www.hastac.org">Humanities, Arts, Science and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory</a>.) The conference will run from May 27–29, 2015, and the workshop will be on May 29 and 30 (Saturday and Sunday, until 3pm).  There are a number of humanists and librarians, in particular, who have gotten involved with Software/Data Carpentry projects, so we should have a great group of volunteers running those bootcamps. We are still finalizing the trainers. I will volunteer there, too.</p>
<p>There is some work that needs to be done to tweak the content of the Data/Software Carpentry lessons for humanists, but there is not too much to do.</p>
<p>I have also been thinking about trying to teach my current DH students a little bit of Javascript, which is the language used in most web programming and, as I learned at the Davis session, can even run a full-fledged server in four lines of code using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN">MEAN</a> stack. (Insane!) I haven't tried that out yet. Since the goal of Software Carpentry, which uses the languages Python and R, is to teach proper programming technique, there is no reason some of the lessons can't be adjusted to use Javascript, too. It's useful for DH people as there are quite a number of neat mapping and visualization tools that work primarily through Javascript. It's also everywhere and difficult to avoid, even if you want to.</p>

<p>I have not updated my blog in such a long time! I hope to fix that, starting now. So watch out for a slew of new posts, until I run out of steam.</p>
<p>I should note, since I mentioned it in an earlier post, that I did get promoted with tenure. So I am now an associate professor. It's an interesting feeling. I want to write more about that in the near future and also think more about the whole university tenure process. All in good time, I suppose.</p>

<p class="last"><em>I Too Have Some Dreams</em> explores the work of N. M. Rashed, Urdu's
renowned modernist poet, whose career spans the last years of British India
and the early decades of postcolonial South Asia. A. Sean Pue argues that
Rashed’s poetry carved out a distinct role for literature in the maintenance
of doubt, providing a platform for challenging the certainty of collective
ideologies and opposing the evolving forms of empire and domination. This
finely crafted study offers a timely contribution to global modernist studies
and to modern South Asian literary history.</p>

<p>I would not be upset if readers judged my book’s insides by its gorgeous cover.</p>
<p>The painting is by Zahoor-ul-Akhlaq (1941–99), a prominent South Asian artist who spent most of his life in the city of Lahore. There are to my mind significant parallels between Zahoor’s painting and N. M. Rashed’s poetry, particularly in their relation to tradition. This painting is untitled but usually referred to as “Falling Bird.”</p>
<p>For those readers who know Urdu, the cover reminds me of a poem of Rashed’s that begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ہمیں یاد ہے وہ درخت جس سے چلے ہیں ہم</p>
<p><em>hameñ yād hai vuh daraḳht jis se chale haiñ ham</em></p>
<p>We remember that tree from which we departed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book will be out in August with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520283107">University of California Press</a>. That's the press of my undergraduate alma mater, so I am thrilled to be publishing with them, and they have been great to work with. The book is in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.saacrossdisciplines.org/%E2%80%8E">South Asia Across the Disciplines</a> series.</p>
<p>I am traveling to the Association for Asian Studies conference this week in Philadelphia. I have heard from friends that traveling is a great time to write blog posts, so I hope to post more soon!</p>

<p>I am working on a paper on the first volumes of free verse, or <em>āzad naz̤m</em>, in Urdu to be submitted to a festschrift for Shamsur Rahman Faruqi, the famous Urdu critic and writer who has been my own advisor Frances Pritchett's teacher and collaborator. As part of that work, I have had the Urdu poet Mīrājī’s volume <em>Mīrājī kī naz̤meñ</em> transcribed, and I am working on a computational analysis of his use of meter as well as sound. I will be comparing Mīrājī’s volume to N. M. Rāshid’s <em>Māvarā</em> and to Taṣadduq Ḥusain Ḳhālid’s first volume. It’s a very preliminary study, but I am very happy to be spending time with Mīrājī’s poetry.</p>
<p>To my mind, a lovely product of that work is a list of Mīrājī’s most common words. For those readers familiar with his oeuvre, these will come as no surprise. Removing the "stop words," or common words that do not reveal much on their own, Mīrājī’s ten most frequent words in that volume are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>
<em>dil</em> (heart)</li>
<li>
<em>rāt</em> (night)</li>
<li>
<em>bāt</em> (words, matter)</li>
<li>
<em>naz̤ar</em> (look, glance, sight)</li>
<li>
<em>āñkh</em> (eye)</li>
<li>
<em>sāyah</em> (shadow)</li>
<li>
<em>rañg</em> (color)</li>
<li>
<em>pal</em> (moment)</li>
<li>
<em>man</em> (mind)</li>
<li>
<em>chāñd</em> (moon)</li>
</ol>
<p>I will do the same for Rāshid and Ḳhālid later, but this list is just too delightful not to share.</p>
