blog commands into Hindi. Should I care to, I can now compose Hindi and Urdu
versions of my posts. The translations of the blog
software are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/nikola/"&gt;crowdsourced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not do much computing in Hindi, so I checked some of the phrases against
the Wordpress translations in addition to querying to see how many instances
there are of particular words on the Internet. For example, one phrase I was
wavering on was the word for archive. अभिलेखागार &lt;em&gt;abhilekhāgār&lt;/em&gt; or “archive” has
217,000 hits (many of which are Indian government archive websites), whereas
अार्काइव &lt;em&gt;ārkāiv&lt;/em&gt; has 592,000. That‘s what the Urdu translation went with as
آرکائیو. So I went with अार्काइव. On the other hand, The Hindi word for
“categories,” श्रेणियाँ &lt;em&gt;shreṇiyāñ&lt;/em&gt;, had 814,000 pages, whereas कैटेगरी &lt;em&gt;kaiṭegarī&lt;/em&gt; had
129,000 and the plural form कैटेगरियां only 49,100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to figure out now what the best current &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://seanpue.com/posts/added-hindi-and-urdu/_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt; styling is for
displaying Hindi and Urdu text on the Internet. Most browsers on recent
computers can handle displaying the text to the extent that it is at least
readable. Urdu in its preferred script, &lt;em&gt;nastaʿlīq&lt;/em&gt;, is rather difficult to
render, so I would be curious to hear suggestions. There are ways of embedding
fonts in webpages that might be a possibility. I have not been following those
technologies very closely, and so it will be interesting to find out how
standardized the techniques are at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>hindi</category><category>urdu</category><category>translation</category><category>css</category><guid>http://seanpue.com/posts/added-hindi-and-urdu/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2014 20:30:41 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
