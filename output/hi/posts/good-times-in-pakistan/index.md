I received a travel grant from the [American Institute of Pakistan Studies] that
brought me to Karachi and Lahore to give talks in February. This is a (late!) blog post about my rejuvenating visit.


On February 8–10, I attended the amazing [Karachi Literature Festival] (KLF) and
participated in a panel launching my new book, [I Too Have Some Dreams: N. M.
Rashed and Modernism in Urdu Poetry]. The panel was well attended, and the
moderators, [Asif Farrukhi] and [Sarah Humayun], both from [Habib University], asked
excellent questions, as did the audience.

In the photo below, I am with friends [Naiza Khan], [Asif Farrukhi], and [Fahd Ali], and in the second with [Kamran Asdar Ali].

I did not know before arriving that there was an  [Art Section] to the KLF!  I was very happy to meet a number of artists, most for the first time.  My book has a beautiful work by Zahoor ul Akhlaq
on the cover, as does the new book by art historian Simone Wille, [Modern Art in Pakistan].  In part because of our mutual love of Zahoor's work, I was invited to the session launching her book, sponsored by [Art Now],  to discuss modernism in
literature and art.

I was also invited to give a talk at the [Indus Valley School of Art and Design (IVS)] on
Digital Humanities, and I enjoyed that very much. I am very interested in the design aspects of DH, and
so it is wonderful for me to address some comments about DH to the IVS audience. I also enjoyed meeting members of the [Vasl Artists’ Collective](http://www.vaslart.org/).

I also had a chance to attend an art event organized by the [Tentative Collective]
that involved a video projection by [Naiza Khan] of images of Manora on the side of building
in Golimar, in an alley near the brass artisans that the artist worked with. My partner [Karin Zitzewitz] had curated Naiza Khan’s exhibit [Karachi Elegies] at the [Eli and Edith Broad Museum] at [my university], so I had met her before, both in East Lansing
and Karachi. Here are some pictures of that and an audio recording as well:

I also gave a well attended lecture entitled “A ‘Punjabi’ Critique of Sufi
Idiom: N. M. Rashed and Urdu Literary Tradition” for the [Department of Social Sciences & Liberal Arts] at the [Institute of Business Administration] in Karachi. The poster for that talk was quite beautiful, and I am including
it below. My (too) complicated talk was covered in the an [article in Dawn]. The article is good but misrepresents my characterization of the poets Faiz
and Rashed, which I have discussed in this [article]. My talk was followed by recitations (lovely, of course) by Dr.
[Nomanul Haq], who has been a friend and colleague of mine for 10(!)+ years. His recitations start at ~52:00 in the audio recording below.

I also gave a talk at [Habib University]. That is an entirely new and lively
university with an innovative curriculum. There I gave a talk entitled ‘The
Digital Divan: Computation Approaches to Urdu Poetry.’ There was a beautiful
poster for that as well, and another nice [article in The Express Tribune].

I later traveled to Lahore where I met with a number of people, including some
literary critics and poets who had helped me with my book research. My friend
the poet Ahmad Attarecited some of his poetry for me and also all four parts of N. M. Rashed’s Hasan Kuzagar. I
hope to post those soon. Ahmad is on the left in the photo below next to M. Salimur Rahman, and with Abbas Tabish and myself in the next. I also made some new friends in Karachi and Lahore
and had a very memorable time. I look forward to returning soon.
